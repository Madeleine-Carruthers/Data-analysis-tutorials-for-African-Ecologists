# Geometric-morphometrics
## An introduction to landmark-based geometric morphometrics for ecologists

This folder contains step-by-step tutorials on preparing and analysing morphological data using a geometric morphometrics approach.

Geometric morphometrics is a powerful approach for quantifying biological shape variation between groups (e.g. between different populations or species), and can be used to look at how an organisms shape/morphology varies with other biotic or abiotic factors in their environment.

Traditional morphometric analyses are based on linear distance-based measurements, such as head length, body depth, eye diameter (Figure A). While these can be highly informative, they do not provide good coverage of an organism’s overall morphology. Geometric morphometrics uses a set of precisely located landmarks to capture morphology (Figure B). We can compare the relative positions of these landmarks configurations to get high coverage, detailed information on shape variation between individuals or groups.

In these tutorials we will introduce you to the practical and statistical methods used in geometric morphometrics. 

All software used in the tutorials are available for free.

## Example data

A practice dataset is provided in the folder “Example data”. The folder contains 20 image files (.jpg) and one metadata file (.csv). These data are taken from Carruthers et al. 2022 [https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.07.475335](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.01.07.475335). Following the step-by-step guides in the tutorials we will quantify morphological variation in body shape between a shallow-water littoral population and a deep-water benthic population of the East African cichlid *Astatotilapia calliptera*.
